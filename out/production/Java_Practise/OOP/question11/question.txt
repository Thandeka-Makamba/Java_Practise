Create an OOP design for a game where:

Thereâ€™s an abstract class called Game.

It has a method start() and an abstract method getWelcomeMessage().

Each specific game (e.g. PuzzleGame, ShootingGame) extends Game.

Each game takes a Level (an enum: EASY, MEDIUM, HARD) as a parameter.

The Level enum has a method getDescription().

Your Task:
Write the Level enum and the PuzzleGame class.
PuzzleGame should override getWelcomeMessage() and return a message that
includes the level's description (e.g., "Welcome to PuzzleGame. Difficulty: Suitable for beginners").
