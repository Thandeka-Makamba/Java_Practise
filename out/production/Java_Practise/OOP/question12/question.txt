Create a program that uses:

An enum called Mood with values: HAPPY, SAD, ANGRY.

An abstract class called Animal with:

A private field mood of type Mood.

A constructor to set the mood.

A getter and setter for mood.

An abstract method makeSound().

Two subclasses: Dog and Cat that override makeSound() based on their current mood:

For example, a HAPPY dog says "Woof! I'm happy!", and a SAD cat says "Meow... I'm sad."
