Create a class called Person with a method greet() that prints "Hello from Person".

Then, create two subclasses: Student and Teacher.

The Student class should override the greet() method to print "Hello from Student".

The Teacher class should override the greet() method to print "Hello from Teacher".

Now, in the Main class:

Create an array of Person objects that contains both Student and Teacher objects.

Loop through the array and call the greet() method on each.

Use instanceof and casting to call a specific method for Teacher objects only. The
Teacher class should have a teach() method that prints "Teaching students".

Make sure that only Teacher objects invoke the teach() method. Student objects should
not invoke this method, and their greet() method should be called instead
