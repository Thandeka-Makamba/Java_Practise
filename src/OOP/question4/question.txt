Create an abstract class Employee with:

A private field name (String)

A private field salary (double)

Constructor to initialize both fields

getName() and getSalary() methods

An abstract method work()

A concrete method displayInfo() that prints the name and salary

Create two subclasses of Employee:

Manager → implements work() and prints "Managing team"

Developer → implements work() and prints "Writing code"

In your Main class:

Create one Manager and one Developer using Employee references (demonstrate polymorphism)

Store them in an Employee[] array

Use a loop to call displayInfo() and work() on each
