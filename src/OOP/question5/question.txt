Create an abstract Animal class with a private field name, a constructor, and an abstract method makeSound().
Then, create two subclasses: Dog and Cat. Both should override the makeSound() method.

Add a displayInfo() method in the Animal class to display the animalâ€™s name, and call this method in
the main program. Finally, create a Main class where you create instances of Dog and Cat, store them in
an array, and display their information and sound.
