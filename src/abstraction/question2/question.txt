Create an abstract class called Animal with the following:

An abstract method: makeSound()

A regular method: sleep() that prints "Sleeping..."

Then, create two subclasses:

Dog – implements makeSound() to print "Woof!"

Cat – implements makeSound() to print "Meow!"

In your Main class:

Create one object of each (Dog and Cat), call makeSound() and sleep() on each.
